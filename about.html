               Justin Bieber is a Canadian singer and songwriter. Born in 1994
               in Stratford, Ontario, Canada, to a single mother, Bieber took
               second place in a local talent competition at a young age. After
               his mother posted YouTube clips of her boy performing, Bieber
               went from an unknown, untrained singer to a budding superstar
               with a big-time record deal with Usher within two years. Bieber
               went on to become the first solo artist to have four singles
               enter the Top 40 before the release of a debut album.
